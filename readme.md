- Project goals.

1.  The images should be in a scrolling area and the search field should stay on the screen.  
- sticky nav

2.  When the user hits enter or presses the search button, it should refresh the display with the new results.  (Please turn ‘safe search’ to the safest setting for the results.)

- loading 100 pictures, need to add for loop to get 25 results, and a search bar where user type what he is searching for.

3.  Show the first 25 images.

- shows 100 right now

4.  Images in the scrolling areas should be resized to fit on-screen fully, and centered horizontally if they don’t reach the left and right edges of the containing element.

- done, althought the pictures looks pixalated
